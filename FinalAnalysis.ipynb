As well, the obesity statistics of Alleghany County also proved to be an interesting factor when compared to our other datasets. For our datasets, we have choosen 3 that represent our metric best:"

    "This dataset offered a lot of great information about fast food establishments in Alleghany County. While it was not the most focused to Pittsburgh, it still porvided plenty of useful information regarding fast food/restaurant availibilty in and around Pittsburgh. As well, it was fairly simple to use with a shape file of the city, as both contained zip code information. Overall, this dataset was a great addition to our project."
