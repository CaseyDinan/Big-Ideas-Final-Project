While it would be assumed that the more developed downtown areas of Pittsburgh would provide the greatest diversity of food options, it is actually the more suburban areas such as Shadyside and Squirrel Hill. Downtown had a plethora of fast food options, but markets in general appear to be consintrated outside the urban centers. This is a good indication of why Pittsburgh's suberbs are so diserable for both young adults and families alike, as they provide far superior food options to the rest of the Pittsburgh area."
